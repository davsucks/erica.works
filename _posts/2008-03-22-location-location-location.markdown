<div class="entry-content">One of the exciting technologies that&#8217;s getting a lot of attention is location-aware devices.  The ability to post location data to the Internet is creating some very interesting applications.

A few years ago, a company came out with a device that can be embedded in a child&#8217;s clothing or backpack.  While this was a prime example of how real-time location information could lead to invasion of privacy, there have been some benign uses of the technology.

One such use is GPS-enabled cameras.  Photographers can easily keep track of exactly where each picture is taken.  Flickr added location data to photos allowing you to browse for photos from a world map.  Lately, a lot of buzz has surrounded Yahoo!&#8217;s <a href="http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/">Fire Eagle</a>.  It&#8217;s basically a location updating service and it&#8217;s opening up some great possibilities, one of which is <a href="http://wikinear.com/">wikinear</a> written by <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Mar/22/wikinear/">Simon Willison</a>.  You can use your location to fetch Wikipedia articles that pretain to landmarks and events that surround you.  A blessing for history geeks!

Another commonly foreseen application is being able to hook up with (or avoid) friends that are nearby.  Some have also suggested using individuals&#8217; location data to measure traffic on highways and in shopping malls.  I can only imagine the sort of alternative reality games that will crop up now that developers can track players&#8217; locations.

Of course, the major impetus for all of this is the iPhone.  Not that the iPhone&#8217;s locator technology is new, but it&#8217;s finally available in an easily usable (and easy to develop for), tight package.
