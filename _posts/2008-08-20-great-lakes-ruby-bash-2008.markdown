I&#8217;m really excited about the upcoming <a href="http://greatlakesrubybash.org/">Great Lakes Ruby Bash</a> in Ann Arbor on October 11th.  The distinguished Rubyists of the Grand Rapids Ruby Users Group are joining forces with us (Ann Arbor Ruby group) to put the conference together.  After attending eRubyCon in Columbus last weekend, I have to say the local conferences are much more engaging than the mega-conferences like RailsConf.  It&#8217;s great being able to get a chance to talk to everyone.  Hope to see you there!
