<div class="entry-content">Today I read an <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/offices-and-the-zone/">interesting post</a> on <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E7D81F3FF933A15751C0A96E9C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">coworking</a> - where small companies and individuals rent a desk or simply a key to access shared office space.  It&#8217;s a really cool concept that fosters collaboration.  Over the past year, I&#8217;ve been going to some <a href="http://gr-ruby.org/">Ruby user</a> <a href="http://wiki.rubymi.org/index.php?title=Southeast_Michigan_Ruby_Users_Group">group meetings</a> and Lansing&#8217;s own <a href="http://webdesign.meetup.com/488/">Web Design Meetup</a>.  It&#8217;s been great throwing ideas around and learning things you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find in a Google search or have show up in your RSS reader.

After reading the article, I realized that I&#8217;m already involved in coworking to a certain extent - <a href="http://www.spamstopshere.com">my own company</a> shares office space with a <a href="http://www.metaspring.com/">small web company</a>.

Recently, the city of East Lansing <a href="http://newsroom.msu.edu/site/indexer/2403/content.htm">announced a plan</a> to convert some old office space above Barnes &amp; Noble into a &#8220;tech incubator&#8221; that sounds a bit like a coworking site, although perhaps not one that&#8217;s open to passers-by.  If anything it might be nice to have a space for when I can&#8217;t commute all the way to Ann Arbor.

Another idea that started in Germany and Austria and has spread to some large cities in the US is that of a <a href="http://www.hackerfoundation.org/wiki/index.php/Hacker_Spaces_Initiative">hacker space</a>.   It&#8217;s basically a rented space where tinkerers and artists can work.  I think it&#8217;s mainly attractive in large cities where people don&#8217;t have space at home to work on &#8220;messy&#8221; projects or for those who just want to collaborate.

In my dreams I&#8217;ve thought about turning the abandoned thrift store across the street into a hacker space&#8230;
