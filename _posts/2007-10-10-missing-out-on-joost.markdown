<a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> looks really awesome.  Tons of free TV shows streamed on demand.  It&#8217;s too bad that their client software isn&#8217;t compiled for PowerPC.  :(  I&#8217;ve only had my PowerBook G4 for 4 years, but maybe it&#8217;s time to upgrade to a MacBook Pro if companies keep leaving PPC users out in the cold.
