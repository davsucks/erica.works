I&#8217;ve moved on from a job cowboy coding (read: shoot from the hip, work alone) ASP.NET websites to a job working at an anti-spam software company using Ruby on Rails, Perl, and sendmail under an agile/eXtreme Programming methodology.  It&#8217;s heavenly bliss!  Definitely worth the hour drive to Ann Arbor each day.

I&#8217;m finding that I&#8217;m much more productive working with a programming partner.  Something about working side by side really spurs me on.  When you work with people with open minds (and have an open mind) it&#8217;s a continuous learning and improvement process.  It also minimizes the stupid mistakes that slow you down as you have another pair of eyes on the situation.  Not only do I learn new techniques and ideas from others, but it also helps me to coalesce ideas that I know intuitively, but gain a better understanding by having to explain them.

Working with Ruby on Rails is also a joy.  It&#8217;s great to be able to whip out features in a matter of hours and spend more time on testing and polishing.  Perl, well, it&#8217;s no Ruby.  It&#8217;s definitely better than C, but given the choice, I&#8217;d go for Ruby.

Ditching Windows has improved my life.  I think my blood pressure has gone down.  My workstation runs Fedora.  Now I don&#8217;t have to worry about antivirus software causing my user interface to crash.  It&#8217;s no Mac OS, but any sort of UNIX works for me.

I&#8217;ve also enjoyed the company pool table and the coolness that is Ann Arbor!
