Well, no sooner than I had written the <a href="http://plusrw.wordpress.com/2008/04/26/rubyrails-on-linux-oh-yeah-perl-too/">previous article,</a> did I consider <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>.  At this point I was willing to try anything, so I downloaded the special Ruby distribution and gave it a whirl.  One of the prereqs was the Java 1.6 runtime, a hefty download.  As NetBeans opened for the first time, I was greeted with a splash screen with a progress bar inching along as various Java libraries were loaded.  This did not bode well!  My bloat-meter was starting to register.  

However, once NetBeans was up and running, I found it to be pretty intuitive and it runs very well.  Response to input is instantaneous and the editor does a good job of not getting in the way.  I really enjoy the SVN integration as well.  It&#8217;s very easy to ignore files and perform the usual updates/commits.  The merging tool has some of the slickness of Apple&#8217;s FileMerge and many of the features of my favorite diff tool, <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/moreinfo.php">Beyond Compare</a>.

My only beef so far is that auto-complete is invoked with CTRL+space and I don&#8217;t think you can map it to TAB and still be able to use TAB for its original purpose.  The autocomplete also only works by selecting items from a drop-down.  It won&#8217;t just guess what you want.  

But overall, NetBeans has been my favorite Linux text editor for Rails.  However, I think I&#8217;ll have to stick with gedit or Eclipse for my Perl editing.
