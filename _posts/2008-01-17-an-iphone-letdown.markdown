One of the cool things with OS X&#8217;s address book is that with my old Sony Ericson phone, I could manage calls.  I would pair the phone with my Mac using address book (by pushing a little bluetooth icon).  Whenever someone called, their vcard and picture would pop up on my screen and I could choose to answer or ignore it.  Of course, I couldn&#8217;t talk through the Mac&#8217;s microphone/speakers, but it was nice when using headphones - I could still catch calls while the music was blasting.   It&#8217;s also interesting to note that under the bluetooth utility, it states the iPhone supports no bluetooth services whatsoever - no file syncing or address book syncing.  So, it&#8217;s really only for bluetooth headsets.  That&#8217;s pretty lame!
