After so many years of using a Mac at home, I started to have thoughts, like, &#8220;well maybe Windows isn&#8217;t that bad.  People seem to get along OK with it.  My work computer has problems, but that&#8217;s probably because I do weird things with it.&#8221;

But then reality hits and I realize how dreadful it is to use a PC.

Things that annoy me about Windows:

* Since Windows has such a good reputation for security, it is mandated that I have Symantec Antivirus installed at work.  This wonderful program causes explorer.exe to hang when I browse files.  Then I get to CTRL+ALT+DEL and restart explorer.exe.  Woohoo!
* The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_document_interface">MDI</a> paradigm is so clunky!  I have two monitors, but apps like Visual Studio can only occupy a single monitor.  I&#8217;d very much like to drag my output/find/project navigation windows to the other screen, but that&#8217;s just not practical in Windows.  MS has tried to make some apps like Word more SDI-like by putting each Word or Excel doc in its own task bar item.  However, Excel has the wonderful habit of closing all spreadsheets when I close a single Excel window.  Word doesn&#8217;t behave like that.  Excel, why can&#8217;t you be more like your brother?!
* Those handy reminders the pop up in the task bar, like &#8220;Outlook is taking too long to respond.&#8221;  I&#8217;m glad that Windows is barging in and spending more CPU cycles to tell me that something is taking a long time to process.
* IE7 is still the worst browser ever made.  How many times have I told it to save my username/password for that site that needs HTTP authentication?  Does it listen? No!  And let&#8217;s not forget IE&#8217;s outright flaunting of web standards.

How is Mac OS better?

* No viruses so far.  However, I have run Windows without AV software for a couple of years without any problems - you just have to stay up to date on patches, stay behind a firewall, and don&#8217;t open suspicious attachments.
* I love SDI.  Not ever Mac app is SDI (like Eclipse) but I love having separate windows that I can put anywhere.  I like having a consistent spot to look for the &#8220;File&#8221; menu.
* No annoying popups.
* OK, browsers aren&#8217;t OS-specific, but at least the browser isn&#8217;t built into OS X.  I still can&#8217;t understand why Microsoft has left IE so tightly coupled with the OS.
