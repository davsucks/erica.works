If you haven&#8217;t tried out <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a> yet, you should.  It&#8217;s free.  It&#8217;s a program for Windows and Mac that lets you fly around a 3D globe and look at satellite images.  It even has 3D terrain, so you can get a cool view of places like the Grand Canyon.

Before our wedding/honeymoon, I was constantly checking Google Earth to see if they would update the satellite photos of the Cancun area so I could get a better idea of where we would be going (OK, maybe I&#8217;m a bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCD">OCD</a>).  I was disappointed because at the time, they only had detailed photos of the Cancun airport.  Yesterday, I found out that Google rolled out a massive update to their imagery, so now they have nice, detailed pics of Cancun and the Riviera Maya.  This morning, I put together a &#8220;sightseeing tour&#8221; of our wedding/honeymoon.  Once you have Google Earth installed, <a href="/grabbag/DergesKastnerWedding.kml">right-click this link</a>, choose &#8220;save as,&#8221; save it to your desktop, then open it and a series of placemarks will be loaded into Google Earth.  Each placemark has a description of what happened at each location.  Have fun!

P.S. For a really spectacular view of Chicago, turn on the &#8220;3D Buildings&#8221; layer in Google Earth by looking in the left-hand list under the &#8220;layers&#8221; section.
