It&#8217;s not very often that I get to seriously consider what my next Mac will be.&nbsp; My 4.5 year old PowerBook is on its last leg with a broken display and dwindling performance.

I&#8217;m stuck trying to decide between two options.&nbsp; Option 1 is to just get a MacBook Pro.&nbsp; A workstation in my lap.&nbsp; Option 2, however, is a bit more intriguing: get a MacBook Air.&nbsp;

I know, you&#8217;re saying to yourself, &#8220;hey, for only $100 more you get a wider screen, a ton of ports, a lot more storage, and improved performance.&nbsp; As a developer why would you even consider a less powerful machine?&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been toying around with the idea of becoming untethered.&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Performance</span>

It&#8217;s true that MBP is significantly faster than the MBA.&nbsp; The 7200RPM BTO hard drive option would blow the MBA&#8217;s puny 4200RPM drive.&nbsp; The MBA has its video memory shared with the main RAM.&nbsp; Games on the MBA wouldn&#8217;t be very good and I wouldn&#8217;t want to do any serious video editing.&nbsp; But when I think about it, when&#8217;s the last time I played a computer game or edited video?&nbsp; In all honesty, web development is more memory intensive than anything.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/131805/2008/01/macbookair_first_tests.html">Macworld recently found</a> that, while the MBA is slower than the MBP, it&#8217;s still significantly faster than the last PowerBook (which was significantly faster than my current machine).&nbsp; So any of Apple&#8217;s current offerings would be an improvement over what I have now.&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Storage</span>

The largest hard drive you can have installed on the MBA is 80GB.&nbsp; I&#8217;m already filling up my 100GB drive and as I watch more online video, take more pictures, and listen to more music, my space requirements are only going to increase.&nbsp; This is probably the primary factor that&#8217;s holding me back.&nbsp; However, I&#8217;ve found that storing my photos on a network share over a 54Mbps wireless connection offers no serious penalty.&nbsp; With an 802.11n connection, it would be even snappier.&nbsp; Thus, storing all of my photos on our home server will leave me plenty of room (21GB) to work with on the MBA.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Efficiency</span>

This is where the MBA shines.&nbsp; The MBP is quite heavy.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t held the MBA yet, but from what I hear, it&#8217;s amazingly lightweight.&nbsp; It would be nice to have to lug less weight around.&nbsp; It would also be nice to have a more compact laptop for on the plane.&nbsp; I loved my 12&#8221; iBook in college and the MBA&#8217;s 13&#8221; screen would be an adequate size.&nbsp;

I also like the idea of a multitouch trackpad.&nbsp; However, it&#8217;s expected that the next MBPs will have that as well in the next couple of weeks.

Overall, it&#8217;s the portability that really draws me to the MBA.&nbsp; While the power of the MBP is compelling, to me it seems like buying a Ford F-350 for my commute to work.&nbsp; I&#8217;d rather go with the Honda Civic.
