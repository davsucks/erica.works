<a href="http://swigartconsulting.blogs.com/tech_blender/2005/09/the_google_powe.html">This article</a> is a little old, but it hit me at just the right time. Lately, I&#8217;ve been on a binge of researching new programming languages and frameworks, now that I have so much free time and the fact that, lately, I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;ve fallen behind a bit after playing so much EU II and focusing on PHP for a year. In the process of playing catchup I started to feel overwhelmed - there&#8217;s so much out there - Hibernate, LINQ, CouchDB, Erlang, Ruby, Smalltalk, hey remember Scheme? SQLite, JQuery, Perl, Spring, ad nauseum.

Really nail down a few major languages and frameworks and you can work from there and google your way across the bridge when you come to it.
