In part 2 we'll go over some very simple quantum gates and explore our first concept that makes quantum computing "quantum" &mdash; Superposition.

_Note: this post is part of my series, [Programming the Multiverse](/programming-the-multiverse-part-1/)_

We're going to start with some basics. I mean, suuuuper basic. But it's an important first step. The way most people interact with quantum computers do so in a way that is similar to FPGAs in the classic world - i.e. hardware that you can program. The most popular way to write quantum algorithms these days is to use a library like Qiskit to define a quantum circuit. This circuit can then be "transpiled" and run on a real quantum computer. You can also just run your circuit in a simulator that runs on your local machine.

At this point in time, we mostly work on the level of piecing together logic gates, as if we're building hard-wired circuits for single-purpose machines. There are not any widely-used "programming languages" for quantum computing. The languages that do exist tend to be pretty esoteric.

So let's review logic gates in the classic world.

## Ye olde logick gates

You may remember these logical gate diagrams, like for the NOT gate:

![A logical NOT gate symbol](../images/multiverse-part-2/not-gate.png)

This logical gate transforms a single bit, 0 into a 1 or a 1 into a 0. It's one of the basic building blocks of every CPU and computing device. Bits are combined to represent bytes of data and the logical gates "move the bits around" to transform the data.

There's even a whole set of math to represent these "bitwise" operations &mdash; AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc. all have special boolean algebra operators that describe them:

#### AND Operation:

$$0 \wedge 1 = 0$$

$$1 \wedge 1 = 1$$

#### XOR Operation:

$$0 \oplus 1 = 1$$

$$1 \oplus 1 = 0$$

In classical computers, in a sense the _data_ is moving around through the gates. You can think of each gate as a function that takes data input, may modify it, then output a result. For example, a NOT gate can be though of as a function `not(x)` where `not(0) == 1` and `not(1) == 0`. The functions combine into higher order functions that may represent mathematical operations or hardware commands.

Utlimately these logic gates form the thousands of building blocks that combine into our modern day, general purpose "integrated circuits" (e.g. CPUs). Our modern programming languages define a series of signals that get sent through this maze of gates. But it's important to note that every integrated circuit can implement the same logical gates using different types of electrical circuits.

## The fancy new quantum gates

You've seen how logic gates work in classical computers operating on bits of information represented by electrical pulses. But we need to completely forget about all of that. We're in quantum world now! Starting out, QC and classic logic gates will seem similar, but we'll see that QC is a complete shift in how we think of computing.

Now let's dive into some of the foundational quantum gates. For now we're just going to focus on their behavior but just know that the way these logical gates are implemented in actual quantum coputers vary and are still under constant development and innovation.

### Quantum circuit diagrams

![A basic quantum circuit diagram](../images/multiverse-part-2/basic-circuit-diagram.png){: height="200" }

Here is the most basic quantum circuit diagram in the world. It does absolutely nothing, except measure the values of two qubits. Let's break it down:

`q0` and `q1` are two qubits. By convention, they are intialized to $$\ket{0}$$.

Whoah, wait a minute! What's this $$\ket{0}$$ thing? Well for now you can think of it just like a regular binary 0 from the classical world. $$\ket{1}$$ represents a 1. It's pronounced "ket-zero" or "ket-one."

Back to the diagram, the `c` represents our "classical register." You can think of this like the wire where our classical computer will read from to get results from our computation. There's only one way to get data from a qubit - that is to "measure it." That is what those meter icons represent. You measure a qubit and the result gets sent to the classical register. This touches on a core feature of quantum computing - the idea of superposition, measurement, and risking the life of SchrÃ¶dinger's cat - but we'll get to that in the future.

For now, you can think of us measuring qubit `q0` and outputing the result to classical register `c0`, as well as measuring qubit `q1` and putting the result in register `c1`. Our old classical computers can then read from the register to get our results.

So from the above diagram we'd read the values of `c0` and `c1` and get `00` because `q0` and `q1` are both initialized to $$\ket{0}$$.

### SWAP Gate

![SWAP Gate](../images/multiverse-part-2/quantum-swap-gate.jpg){: height="200" }

A swap gate is very simple. It simply swaps the inputs. If `q0` is $$\ket{1}$$ and `q1` is $$\ket{0}$$ then after the gate `q0` becomes $$\ket{0}$$ and `q1` becomes $$\ket{1}$$. Our registers would read `01` after the measurements.

### CNOT Gate

The CNOT is similar to your familiar old NOT gate. However, it has some special behaviors that we'll cover later. For now, just know that it has a special "control" input that tells the gate whether to actually perform the NOT operation.

![CNOT Gate](../images/multiverse-part-2/cnot.png){: height="200" }

In the example above, `q0` is set to $$\ket{1}$$ and is sent to the "control" input of the gate. `q1` is set to $$\ket{0}$$ and is sent to the operand input. The result is that `q1` changes to $$\ket{1}$$. If `q0` were set to $$\ket{0}$$ then `q1` would remain $$\ket{0}$$.

### H Gate

The H Gate, also known as the Hadamard gate, does something interesting.

![H Gate](../images/multiverse-part-2/h-gate.png){: height="200" }

By default, qubit `q0` is set to $$\ket{0}$$. If we were to run this circuit once, when we measure it we may get a $$\ket{0}$$, but we may also randomly get a $$\ket{1}$$. If you run this circuit repeatedly, about 50% of the time you get one result or the other. In a way this is like a random number generator, but behind the scenes, the H gate puts the qubit into **Superposition**.

One of the unique behaviors of quantum physics is that certain particles, for example electrons, are in an unknown state until we "measure" that thing. What do we mean by "measure?" Well that is an enormous philosophical question we don't have time for here.

![Measuring an electron](../images/multiverse-part-2/electron.jpg){: height="200" }

But to simplify, for an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus, we don't know the actual position of that electron until we fire a laser at it ("measure" it) and read how the field of the electron altered the course of photons emitted by the laser. But we only know the position in that moment of time. We can measure this electron multiple times and get a probability distribution of where that electron tends to be located.

When we measure a qubit and put the result into the classical registers, the value that is measured is not binary, but it's converted into a 0 or 1 value. A quantum computer interprets our quantum gates as instructions on how to alter the probability of the qubit of being converted into that 1 or 0 value.

Let's say we use a 6-sided die to represent a qubit. And imagine it's constantly spinning/rolling until we measure it. You could decide that a roll of 1-3 would give you a 0 and a roll of 4-6 would give you a 1. So when we "measure" the die by letting it fall on the table and settle onto a side, we convert the number we rolled into a 0 or 1 bit.

So to recap, the H gate takes our qubit that has a known state, either $$\ket{0}$$ or $$\ket{1}$$, and puts it into an unknown state, where if measured, will give us a 50% chance of getting a $$\ket{0}$$ or $$\ket{1}$$.

And that's it! These are the building blocks to creating all kinds of fun quantum circuits. In the next part, we'll dig into more quantumness and some simple mathematical notation to represent qubits.

But please beware! Any time we put a qubit into superposition and measure it, we are creating two new universes, one where the qubit is 0 and the other where it is 1. So please limit this operation so that the multiverse doesn't run out of memory ðŸ˜…
