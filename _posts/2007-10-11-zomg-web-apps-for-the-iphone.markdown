Apple just released their <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/">official directory of web apps</a> for the iPhone.  I&#8217;ve been playing around with the Facebook app and it&#8217;s really neat.  They did a nice job of fitting everything onto the tiny screen.  Also, you can tap on phone numbers and it will start a call to that number.  You can click on addresses and it will open the Google Maps app with that address.  Very cool!
