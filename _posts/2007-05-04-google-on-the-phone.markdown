When I first got my cell phone a few months ago, I tried browsing to GMail since I finally had a phone that could handle it.  While checking my mail, I noticed a link advertising their GMail app.  I downloaded it and ran it.  Very cool!  It&#8217;s just like using GMail on your PC (well almost).  You can easily access messages and do all the GMail things you can do with your PC. Sweet!

Another app I found was Google Maps for cell phones.  I had tried going to Google maps with my phone&#8217;s web browser, but lo and behold!  A link to a Google maps app for cell phones!  I promptly installed it.   It&#8217;s just as smooth as Google maps for PC and it&#8217;s great to basically have a nav system right on your phone.  It gives directions and finds businesses (but it won&#8217;t route you in real time).

The applications have come in handy up here in Lansing.  At work, they heavily restrict our internet usage,  so it&#8217;s nice to be able to check and respond to important emails during the day.  Last night, my wife had given me directions to a Kinko&#8217;s to fax some loan documents.  When I got there, there was a sign saying it was closed due to loss of power.  I fired up Google Maps and found the other Kinko&#8217;s across town.
